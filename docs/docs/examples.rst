Django Manifest Loader is the glue connecting your front end to your back end. Because of it's importance in the full 
stack, and because of the complications when trying to get your javascript app to play nicely with your python app, 
there are multiple examples of Django Manifest Loader in use in the `project's Github repo
here <https://github.com/shonin/django-manifest-loader/tree/dev/example_projects>`_.
